## Animal Crossing New Horizons: Villager Wishlist
When an Animal Crossing player starts to develop their island, they are able to invite up to 10 villagers to their island. However, there are at least 390 villagers of 35 different animal species, with all different interests and personality types. Therefore, when a new villager comes to your island, the players are usually unsure of what kind of villager they are, and what type of personality they have.  

That being said, this villager wishlist app that has all information about the villagers, and allows users to filter by the type of animal, gender, and personality, and their favorite villagers can be saved onto their wishlist.
